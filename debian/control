Description: Puppet module for apt
 Puppet lets you centrally manage every important aspect of your system
 using a cross-platform specification language that manages all the
 separate elements normally aggregated in different files, like users,
 cron jobs, and hosts, along with obviously discrete elements like
 packages, services, and files.
 .
 The APT module provides a simple interface for managing APT source, key,
 and definitions with Puppet.
